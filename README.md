	This is the focal dataset which links the locations of the different libraries in the Howard County.
	It contains the name of the libraries, their ID, address and the geometric points. By visualizing 
	and analyzing this dataset, we can assess the area in the vicinity of the library to identify
	different primary schools.

Description 
------------
	
	The new datset " Library - Elementary Schools.csv " is created by joining the focal dataset (Libraries.csv) and 		Elementary_School_Districts.csv. By analysing this dataset we can answer the following question:
	<i> Determine the count of elementary and private schools in the vicinity of the libraries in Howard County. </i>
	The results can be best visualized using a pie chart. 
	The pie chart will represent percentage of elementary schools around every library in Howard County. The result will 	help us determine the total number of schools in the vicinity of the libraries which will help the libraries 
	* Note: The validity of the results is restricted to the scope of the datasets.
